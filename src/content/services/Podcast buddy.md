The podcast buddy, will be alter-ego during recording a podcast. Instead of waiting for others to join your podcast recording, use our podcast buddy.


# Objectives 
In cases that you just want to record a podcast and there are no one that is nearby, just call the podcast buddy and you will be perfectly fine.




## Methods

You are the main character of the podcast, but you can control the A.I assistant to perform the following tasks:


1. Asking you delibarating questions.
2. Comment on things that you just said.
3. Making some background sounds.
4. Reveal some emotions during the record.
5. Say some funny stuff.


And ofcourse you can choose who might be your friend...
